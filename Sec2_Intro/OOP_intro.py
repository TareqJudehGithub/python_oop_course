OOP

- What is OOP? OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design
  around objects.
- Programming paradigm is an approach used to solve problems with code, it
  is a way of programming, a way of analyzing the problem and write solutions
  in our code.
- Programming paradigms:
     - Imperative programming. A paradigm where we write each code in a separate
       line. It is the way we write code when first start learning coding.
     - Functional programming. codes built inside functions.
     - Declarative programming.
     - Logic programming.

- class. Class is like blueprints, which is used to create other objects. In 
  the classes we defines the state and the behavior of the object.
- Each object will have it's own state and behavior.  
- Objects are likes lego, they are separate, but we can combine them together
  to solve problems.

- Why OOP?
     Modularity, extensibility, and reusability leads to improved software
     productivity.
     - Modularity. We can make changes to the modules without making large-scale
       changes to the code since the design is modular.
     - Extensibility. Objects can be extended to include new attributes and
       behaviors. 
     - Reusability. Reusability leads to faster and lower cost of development.
       The class header is stored in memory, but objects instantiated from that
       class are not, as they look for that class and call it.
